# Oberon

In this project I seek to expand my knowledge about backend development. I also look for the language stack and libraries that I feel most comfortable working with.

In this case, for the development of the Backend I will be using NodeJS as the execution environment and NestJS as the library, GraphQL as the query language, Prisma as the ORM and for the MongoDB database. On the Frontend side I am going to use React and Typescript, as a component library and Tailwind styles with RadixUI.

This project is one of the challenges of the FrontendMentor page in which I will be developing a space for product reviews.

# Challenge details

Your challenge is to build out this product feedback application and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

We provide the data in a local data.json file, so use that to populate the content on the first load. If you want to take it up a notch, feel free to build this as a full-stack application!

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, read, update, and delete product feedback requests
- Receive form validations when trying to create/edit feedback requests
- Sort suggestions by most/least upvotes and most/least comments
- Filter suggestions by category
- Add comments and replies to a product feedback request
- Upvote product feedback requests
- **Bonus:** Keep track of any changes, even after refreshing the browser (localStorage could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)
- **Bonus:** Build this project as a full-stack application

Download the project and go through the `README.md` file. This will provide further details about the project and help you get set up.
